<br>The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is the regulatory authority, among others, for engineering and technical courses. No engineering college or technical institution can be established without the prior approval of the AICTE. The introduction of new courses and increasing the intake capacity in the existing ones also need its approval. It has been cautioning students through frequent public notifications not to take admission into institutions and courses not approved by it. AICTE normally updates lists of new institutes and branches added to it on its website. 
<br>
<br>Students and parents should be couscious of the problem not only related to the unrecognised institutions, but also to unapproved programmes offered by many recognised institutions. Referring to the spate of misleading advertisements in newspapers issued by recognised institutions, the AICTE in a public notification issued in June 2000 advised the students and their parents to verify the status of approval of the training programmes before seeking admissions, either from its website (www.aicte.com) or from its regional offices. 
<br>
<br>It may be relevant to mention that the Shipping Corporation of India, which recruits degree holders in mechanical engineering as Trainee Marine Engineers, insists that during the interview, the candidates must produce documentary proof in the form of letters from Principals of colleges where they has studied that the Mechanical Engineering Courses offered by them has the approval of the AICTE. The letter should quote AICTE's approval letter number and indicate that the validity of AICTE's approval covered the entire duration of the course. 
<br>
<br>In view of the large-scale proliferation of institutions, the AICTE is keen to ensure that the quality of programmes offered by them is not compromised with. It has, therefore, set up the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) which has introduced a system of accreditation of each programme offered by the recognised institutions (See Chapter 8-Recognition, Accreditation and Ranking of Institutions). Up-to-date information about accreditation is readily available from AICTE's website.
