<br><b>State Level Admissions for Pre Engineering Courses</b>
<br>Almost all the States have centralised the process of admission to the first degree courses in all the engineering and technical institutions within their respective jurisdictions by conducting common entrance tests. The entrance examinations are generally conducted by designated universities or agencies specifically established for this purpose. The admission process involves qualifying in the tests followed by counselling in respect of institutions to be admitted and the branches of study. 
<br>
<br>Admission to engineering colleges and institutions are governed by rules framed by each State Government which include fulfilment of specified domicile requirements. A certain number of seats are also allocated to students who are not domiciled in the concerned States. They can take admission only to seats reserved for AIEEE or "payment seats or management quota"
