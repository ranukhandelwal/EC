	Pattern of AIEEE exam 
	<br><b>PATTERN OF AIEEE QUESTION PAPERS</b>&lt;BR
<br>Always keep in the mind that the pattern of the question paper is divided in to 3 categories. This knowledge will help the students to go through the paper from the easier question to the difficult once.&lt;BR
<br>The 3 categories of a question paper are:
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Easy Portion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Average Portion
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Difficult Portion
<br>
<br>The easy and average questions ensure selection whereas the difficult questions make the merit. The cut-off in most of the exams moves between 60-70%. You can score up to 70% marks easily by focusing the easy and average areas of the question paper. Please ensure that the initial 2 hours of the examination time should be focused on easy and the average section of the question paper and then decide whether to move to difficult area or revise the attempted ones, in order to ensure the high strike rate.
