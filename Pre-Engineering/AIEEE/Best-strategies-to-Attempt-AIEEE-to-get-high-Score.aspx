<br><b>STRATEGY 1: LINEAR APPROACH</b>
<br>This is the most simple and straight forward approach to attempt a paper. In this approach you attempt the paper as it comes, which means you start from first question and go till last question in a fixed sequence. A slightly modified and better form of this approach is that you decide the sequence in which you would like to answer the question paper. For example if after browsing you find that chemistry is easiest followed by physics and ultimately maths , so you attempt the paper in that sequence but once you start with one subject you attempt it sequentially and completely. 
<br>
<br>The disadvantages of this method are
<br>- Since all the subjects have individual cutoffs, so over performing in one subject and under performing in another, will be of no use.
<br>- Since you are attempting the questions in a sequential manner there is a possibility that you may not be able to reach the last question. So you may leave some questions which were easy .
<br>
<br><b>STRATEGY 2: ALLOT TIME FOR EACH SECTION</b>
<br>Spend 4-5 minutes to browse the paper and then decide the sequence in which you would like to attempt the paper. Also allocate time to different sections of the paper and follow it subsequently.
<br>
<br><b>STRATEGY 3: BROWSE AND ATTEMPT AS YOU GO APPROACH</b>
<br>In this approach you spend first 20-30 minutes of total time to run through the entire paper. During this you find out memory based questions and solve them immediately. Now whatever time is left you allot that to individual sections and go for it. 
<br>So by the end of this time
<br>- You have seen the entire paper 
<br>- Solved all easy questions of the subjects
<br>- Clearly decided the sequence in which you would like to attempt the paper .
<br>
<br><b>STRATEGY 4 : THREE ROUND APPROACH</b>
<br>This approach is based on the examiner's mind of setting the paper .Always keep in mind that normally questions in any competitive exam can be categorised into 3 areas
<br>
<br>-easy - 25% questions
<br>-average - 60% questions
<br>-difficult - 15% questions
<br>In this approach you attempt the paper in three rounds
<br>First round for easy questions and should be ideally 15% of the total time
<br>Second round is for average questions and should be ideally 70% of the total time
<br>Third round is for difficult questions and should ideally be of 15% of the total time
<br>
<br>So you should focus on careful selection of the easy and average questions and avoid difficult questions in the first and second round . Come back to them once you have completed the entire paper 
<br>While starting the second round it is recommended that you attempt the paper in reverse order . That is instead of going back to question 1, you start from last question. The reason for this is that you have just read quesn 120 and it is fresh to your memory so you would take less time to solve that question.

<br>Have you ever thought how much time does it take to mark an answer in the response sheet. Usually you do not think about it because you think that it is too small a thing to think about. But you would be surprised to know that normally the time taken to mark a response varies between 5 to 10 seconds per question. So if you attempt 90 questions and take on an average 7 seconds to mark the responses, the total time consumed is = 7 x 90 = 630 seconds = 10.5 minutes. In a competitive exam like AIEEE , this is indeed a significant amount of time.
<br>
<br>First thing for sure is that if you are aware of it then you can try to reduce this time by practice. <b>Use actual OMR sheets for marking while practicing </b>
<br>Next question is when to mark answers. These are the various methods adopted by the students .
<br>
<br><b>Mark the responses simultaneously</b> In this method you solve question 1 and then mark it immediately and so on. 
<br>Advantage is that you do not face a situation where you are not able to mark all the responses due to scarcity of time. But the disadvantage is that every time you mark to response, there is a shift in the thinking mode of mind from solving a question to marking and darkening a circle. You can waste a lot of time moving from question booklet to response sheet and back.
<br><b>Solve the questions first and mark the responses in the end</b> The disadvantage is that at times you get so busy in solving questions that you do not realise that the time is over and in the end you are not able to mark the complete responses. But the advantage is that you save on time and moreover the concentration is also higher.
<br><b>Mixed Approach (RECOMMENDED)</b>
<br>Recommended method is that you mark the responses after every round of problem solving, say after you finish each section and before you start next. By following this method you do not loose concentration and time and at the same time you do not reach a situation where you are not able to mark the complete responses. After the first two rounds adopt.

<br>From your preparations you know what is your best subject and what is the weakest. Say you are best in Chemistry, OK in MAths and bit weak in Physics. And say you have 3 hours for total paper.
<br>
<br>1. First 15 mins read whole paper. If you see some easy question which you know from memory then attempt then immediatly.
<br>2. Now time left is 2 hours 45 mins. Keep some buffer time for end and allot rest of it for each section. Say 45 mins
<br>3. Since chemistry is your strogest subject, start with it. Dont mark answers on answer sheet now.
<br>4. Stop wherever you are after 45 mins. Mark all answers now. It may take 2-4 mins to mark all answers. Time left 180-15-45-3=117 mins
<br>5. Start next best subject, say Maths. Same with this, spend 45 mins and mark all answers in end. Time left 117-45-2= 70 mins. 
<br>7. Now Take the last subject, physics, and spend same time on that. You may spend little more time on last subject as you are bit weak in it. Say you sepnd 7-8 mins more on it. Mark answers, 2-3 mins. Now time left 70-45-7-3=15 mins
<br>8. Spend last 15 mins on partially solved questions of each section which you marked before. Now mark each question as you solve, otherwise you may forget them in end. 
<br>
<br><b>More TIPS</b>
<br>1. While you leave a section, there will be some questions which you solved partially and you can solve with little more time. Note them for end. It will save time in identifying questions to solve in end
<br>2. Starting with strongest subject, you can save some time for the weaker subject. Also it will increase confidence as you will be sure about questions you attempted. 3. Saving 15 mins for end helps a lot. As you have tried each section, you will be able to choose best partially solved/unsolved questions to spend this time.
<br>4. There is cut-off for each section and you have to perform in all. So follow the time deadlines as decided very rigidly.
<br>5. Chemistry is usually the starting subject for most students, as more questions are theory based and can be answered with almost no calculations. This gives more time for maths and Physiscs.
<br>
<br>
<br>We hope these tips help you in maximizing your performance.
<br>All the best
