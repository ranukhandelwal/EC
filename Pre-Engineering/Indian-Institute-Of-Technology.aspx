<br>The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), are a group of thirteen autonomous engineering and technology-oriented institutes of higher education established and declared as Institutes of National Importance by the Parliament of India. The IITs were created to train scientists and engineers, with the aim of developing a skilled workforce to support the economic and social development of India after independence in 1947. The students and alumni of IITs are colloquially referred to as IITians.
<br>In order of establishment they are located in 
<br>
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur (1950; as IIT 1951[1]) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Mumbai (1958) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Chennai (1959) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Kanpur (1959) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Delhi (1961; as IIT 1963) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Guwahati (1994) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Roorkee (1847; as IIT 2001) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Bhubaneswar (2008) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Gandhinagar (2008) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Hyderabad (2008) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Patna (2008) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Punjab (2008) 
<br>Indian Institute of Technology - Rajasthan (2008) 
<br>
<br>The Government of India has announced plans to add three more IITs, to be established at Indore, Mandi and Varanasi (via conversion of the IT BHU). 
<br>
<br><b>IIT Admissions</b>
<br>Admission to undergraduate B.Tech and integrated M.Tech programs are through IIT-JEE (the Joint Entrance Examination) in which around 300,000 students appear annually out of which only 5,500 get selected. <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" Text="Click here to know more about IIT - JEE" NavigateUrl="~/pre-engineering/indian-institute-of-technology.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> 
<br>Admission to most postgraduate courses in IITs is granted through various written entrance examinations: GATE (for M.Tech.)
<br><asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink2" runat="server" Text="Click here to know more about GATE 2009 and GATE 2010" NavigateUrl="~/engineering/gate.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> 
<br>JAM (for M.Sc.) and CEED (for M.Des.). 
<br>The admission for Ph.D. program is based primarily on a personal interview, though candidates may also have to appear for written tests. The IITs are also well known for their special reservation policy, which is significantly different from the one applied in other educational institutions of India.</div>
