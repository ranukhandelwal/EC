<br>
<br>When a new entrepreneur enters a business with dreams in their eyes and skills to win the world their aspirations can be called as emerging business. And in the IT sector there has been much more than expected emerging business in the last couple of year. Thus there have been several business proposals for such technology too. 
<br>
<br>Technology &amp; Entrepreneurial Strategy (TES) for emerging technologies and historical cases of technology commercialization encourages emerging business to map out the implications of these new technologies and to incorporate the lessons-learned from cases. TES highlights the new technologies in each sector which have a high probability of revolutionary impact. If you have particular knowledge of ,or interest in,an emerging technology you can always make use of such business proposals to make the most of it. 
<br>
<br>As far as the business implications are concerned, As new technological possibilities emerge, there are often several markets or business implications. For example, (1) traditional business practices may become more efficient with the new technology, allowing the same things to be done with considerably less time or money. (2) allow a totally new way to solve the same or similar overall business problem. (3) trigger an entirely novel product or service category, solving problems previously untouchable or unrealized. (4) new collateral business opportunities. 
<br>
<br>As you look at a wide range of emerging technologies in the various sectors, you should think, and even wildly guess about potential business implications, from the more efficient through novel or collateral. The bolder or more dramatic the idea you think up and present, or the larger the potential market consequences, the more appealing from the perspective of emerging business. 
<br>
<br>Each emerging technology area is fruitful territory for multiple business opportunities. you should let your imagination reign free in order to speculate thoroughly about the most interesting of these implications.

<br><b>EMERGING BUSINESS PROPOSALS FOR TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA</b> 
<br>
<br>"Even until a few years back, replete with infrastructure deficiencies like inadequate water and power supplies and poor roads, India seemed like a least likely destination for high- manufacturing. But now with an explosive consumption of electronic goods and equipment, the hardware and manufacturing sector is all set to see an upswing," says Alok Bhardwaj, Vice President, canon India. 
<br>
<br>Since a few years the common indian has displayed a sudden craving for newer technology-enabled gods. This is indeed a good news for emerging businesses as the doors of not only the software field but the hardware one is also opened to them. The apex body for hardware manufacturers in India, has touched nearly 4.7 million units, with a healthy 30% project annual growth. Along with it add on peripherals too, like the printers, monitors and the keyboards have grown by a phenomenal 43%, 40%, 38% each. 
<br>
<br><b>OUTSOURCING</b> 
<br>
<br><b>Business proposals outsourcing</b> 
<br>
<br>The concept of outsourcing started with Rose Perot when he founded an electronic Data Systems in 1962. EDS would tell a prospective client, "you are familiar with designing, manufacturing and selling furniture, but we are familiar with managing information technology. we can sell you the information technology you need, and you pay us monthly for the service with a minimum commitment of two to ten years. 
<br>
<br>BPO is act of transferring some of an organization's repeated non core and core business processes to an outside provider to achieve cost reductions while improving service quality. Because the processes are repeated and a long term contract is used, outsourcing goes far beyond the use of consultants. If done well, BPO results in increasing shareholder value. The main difference between BPO and more traditional IT outsourcing is that BPO offers companies a way of achieving transformational outcomes much more quickly. In a typical BPO contract, a service provider takes over a specific corporate function. Effective BPO encompasses much more than just changing who is responsible for performing the process. In BPO, the outside provider not only takes only the responsibility to manage the function or business process, but also re-engineers the way the process has been traditionally done. 
<br>
<br>The next generation of business process outsourcing has emerged as a priority for business looking to better options in, managing their application portfolios. the first wave offered low-cost, off-shore development labor, but today firms are demanding new, less risky options for applications that are strategic, complex or mission critical, while still taking cost into consideration. Outsourcing has moved from a niche technology management tool to a mainstream strategic weapon. Business Process Outsourcing leverages process driven efficiencies in terms of organizational excellence, responsiveness &amp; branding, financial efficiency and customer relationship. BPO is emerging as a powerful and flexible approach that business leaders can used to achieve a wide range of tactical and strategic aims. 
<br>
<br>The most common business business process that get outsourced is call centers. Call centers and Help Desks of many multinational and fortune 500 companies are being outsourced to low waged, English speaking countries such as Philippines and India. Countries like India with vast IT human resources are also attracting outsourcing from American IT/Technology companies to outsource their IT Help Desks. Many of these help desks are state of the art with latest Help Desk software and help desk hardware with technical savvy IT graduates behind them answering your questions. 
<br>
<br><b>Knowledge Proposals Outsourcing </b>
<br>
<br>There is tremendous potential in the knowledge process outsourcing space. Only companies that have a strong pedigree, domain expertise, clear focus on the high end space, a proactive solution orientation and a collaborative mindset will emerge as the winners. 
<br>
<br>While outsourcing is present in numerous business functions, including manufacturing, legal, financial and human resources, it is term BPO ( Business Process Outsourcing) that is largely in the news on a daily basis. India's capabilities in this have been moving towards enhancing the nature of the work done. From mere data entry kind of work, the focus has shifted to transaction processing. Now there is a nascent move towards knowledge process outsourcing (KPO). 
<br>
<br>Unlike in BPO where the focus is on executing standardized routine processes, KPO involves processes that demands advanced information search, analytical, interpretation and technical skills as well as some judgement and decision making. Examples of KPO functions are intellectual property or patent research, R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, data mining, database creation, and a range of analytical services such as equity research, competitive intelligence, industry reports and financial modelling. Many of these activities lend themselves to remote execution from anywhere. 
<br>
<br>Typical users of KPO services include market research and consulting firms, investment banks and financial services institutions, industry associations, media, publishing and database firms, and corporate planning departments of large fortune 500 companies. Several global players such as McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Reuters, IMS Health, Harris Interactive, Ipsos, Martiz, AC Nielsen, TN0S and the WPP ground are already using India as a remote base. 
<br>
<br><b>CONCLUSION</b> 
<br>
<br>There have been a large scope and variety for the emerging business in the technical area for few years. New technological advancements and a breakthrough in .net have opened new doors to the new entrepreneurs in the market. There have been several software companies to mushroom around metros and there is a scope for even more. This is a direct effect of outsourcing techniques adopted by the large companies which make the new companies to grow and prosper. There are two types outsourcing business proposals outsourcing that generally does not require any special skills in the employee or entrepreneurs. But there is another type of outsourcing emerging rapidly, known as knowledge proposals outsourcing which requires specialists in the area of job. Such proposal is really going to pay to the emerging business in the technical field. 
<br>
<br>The software revolution and outsourcing and a crash in the prices of technical products has not only given rise to several software companies but the rise in the number of hardware companies have also gone up as a consequences. Government has also been lenient for the companies who want to establish themselves as a part of technological development in India. 
<br>
<br>With a good leadership quality business can emerge as an E-business that has made the interface of producers and consumers more interactive and have developed a closer relation in the customer and manufacturer. Customer can purchase and even pay for the products online ranging from just a small article of little value, or any electronic good to any software product. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, we can conclude it is high time for emerging businesses and the iron was never as hot as it is today and the sooner these companies hit it, the greater success they achieve. The facts and figures show there are scopes for software companies, hardware companies ranging from notebooks to peripherals, and internet service providers, and independent marketing like e-biz, which also provides with a webspace to the customers. Such companies are also encouraged by the government and there is so much to choose from for technical companies.
