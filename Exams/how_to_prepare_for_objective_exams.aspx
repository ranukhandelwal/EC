<br>Preparing for objective exams is different. Before preparing for exams you should check which part of your personality is under test. This is beside your preparation of subject and will decide how should you prepare for subject.

<br><asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" Text="Please click here to see what objective exams are intended for." NavigateUrl="~/exams/should_i_prepare_full_syllabus_for_competitive_exams.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> This will help in deciding how to prepare for objective tests. 
<br>
<br><b>General Info about objective exams</b><b>:</b>
<br>Objective exams include true-false, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and multiple choice questions. The word objective refers to the scoring and indicates there is only one correct answer. Objective tests rely heavily on your skill to read quickly and to reason out the answer.
<br><b>General Suggestions - </b>
<br>- read the directions for the whole test and each subsection. 
<br>- Note the number of items and figure out how much time you have to answer each one, infact I will suggest divide and rule. Divide questions in groups(e.g. 120 questions divided in 4 groups of 30 question each and plan time for group of these 30 questions) 
<br>- Are there penalties for guessing? If not, then guess when you don't know the answer. But if there is penalty, be careful. 
<br>- Answer the easy items first to get the maximum number of points. One good approach is to go on answering all questions in first go. If some question is taking more time or if you are not sure then mark it and come to it after your finish first round. Don't waste time in such questions or you can miss easy questions. 
<br>- Change your answer only if you have reason to do so; research indicates that in 3 out of 4 times your first choice was probably correct. 
<br>- Return to questions you couldn't answer initially and try them again. 
<br>- Don't waste time reviewing answers of which you are confident are correct. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>True-False</b> 
<br>- If there is more than one fact to the statement, check corrections of each part. If one part is false, the item is wrong unless there is a qualifying word such as usually or sometimes. 
<br>- Words like always and never tend to indicate that the statement is false, especially if you can think of an exception. Always and never are absolutes; true absolutes are rare. 
<br>- When the statement is given negatively, state the item without the "no" or "not" and see if it is true or false. If now the statement reads "true," mark it false. Matching 
<br>- Find out if each item is used only once or if some are used more than one once. 
<br>- Check off the answers you have used already. 
<br>- Analyze the choices to see if any parts of the term or word you know will then allow you to associate it with the right answer. 
<br>
<br><b>Fill-in-the-Blank</b> 
<br>- Check the number of lines per answer to see if they indicate the number of letters or words. 
<br>- If you can't remember the exact word, write something related or an explanation. 
<br>- Use appropriate endings to fit the statement/question. 
<br>
<br><b>Multiple-Choice</b> 
<br>- If the question is long and complex, underline the subject and verb to help you. 
<br>- Read the question and answer it in your mind; then look for the matching answer. 
<br>- Read all the alternatives, saying "probable" or "not probable" before making a decision. 
<br>- Ask yourself if you are dealing with a fact or the understanding of some fact. 
<br>- If a question is in the negative; for example, "one of the following is not a cause," look for three true answers and the one remaining false answer will be correct one to mark. 
<br>- Note appropriate grammatical structure from the question to the alternative. 
<br>- General statements are more likely to be correct than specific statements, especially if you can think of one exception. 
<br>- In questions that have complex alternatives involving more than one right answer, mark each item as true or false. When you finish all the alternatives, you will have the answer. 
<br>- Check the answer sheet with the question sheet to make sure the numbering corresponds.
