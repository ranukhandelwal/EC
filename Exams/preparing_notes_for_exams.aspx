<br>Notes making is a very good practice. It has many advantages like
<br>
<br>1) By writing you remember more 
<br>2) I improves your understanding of topic 
<br>3) Fastest and smartest way of revising your subject 
<br>
<br>- Make notes short and concise 
<br>- Maintain formulas, short-cuts and tips/tricks in notes 
<br>- Every field of study has its own vocabulary, so identify words and terms used to represent specific concepts. Maintain them in your notes. 
<br>- Sometimes objective questions can be used to test your ability to distinguish concepts, ideas, theories, events, facts from each other. Construct diagrams, charts, tables or lists to summarize relationships 
<br>
<br>To create notes people use different approaches -
<br>
<br><b>Linear notes:</b> Method where you write neat notes by making some heading, sub heading etc <b>Pattern notes:</b> Using more of flow charts or flow diagram to mention about the topic rather then linear text <b>Mixed approach:</b> A good combination of Linear notes and patter notes. How to divide is individual's choice. 
<br>
<br>One more fact I wish to emphasis is to write notes so that even others can understand them. This is not because you are making notes for others but because
<br>
<br>- I had seen many students fail to understand even their own notes say after 3-4 months 
<br>- If you are doing group studies then exchanging notes will save a lot of time.
