<br>Frankly speaking I don't know answer of this question. This is the toughest question to answer and I think there cannot be direct answer to this question. It varies for individual to individual and from time to time. But for sure following rules apply
<br>
<br>1) Regular studies gives better results 
<br>2) Follow a time table 
<br>3) Have good gaps in between for recreation/sports 
<br>4) Try puzzles, quizzes to sharpen your brain 
<br>5) Test your self regularly to see where you stand and plan accordingly. 
<br>
<br>Even then I'll say ask your individual questions here and we all reading this page will try to help you. You can be frank here as your identity is not disclosed
