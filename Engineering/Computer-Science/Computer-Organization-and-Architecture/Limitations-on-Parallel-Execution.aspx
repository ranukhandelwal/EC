<br>
<br>&bull; The situations which prevent instructions to be executed in parallel by a superscalar architecture are very similar to those which prevent an efficient execution on any pipelined architecture (see pipeline hazards - lectures 3, 4). 
<br>&bull; The consequences of these situations on superscalar architectures are more severe than those on simple pipelines, because the potential of parallelism in superscalars is greater and, thus, a greater opportunity is lost. 
<br>&bull; Three categories of limitations have to be considered: 
<br>1. Resource conflicts: 
<br>- They occur if two or more instructions compete for the same resource (register, memory, functional unit) at the same time; they are similar to structural hazards discussed with pipelines. Introducing several parallel pipelined units, superscalar architectures try to reduce a part of possible resource conflicts. 
<br>2. Control (procedural) dependency: 
<br>- The presence of branches creates major problems in assuring an optimal parallelism. How to reduce branch penalties has been discussed in lectures 7&amp;8. 
<br>- If instructions are of variable length, they cannot be fetched and issued in parallel; an instruction has to be decoded in order to identify the following one and to fetch it Þsuperscalar techniques are efficiently applicable to RISCs, with fixed instruction length and format. 
<br>3. Data conflicts: 
<br>- Data conflicts are produced by data dependencies between instructions in the program. Because superscalar architectures provide a great liberty in the order in which instructions can be issued and completed, data dependencies have to be considered with much attention. 
<br>Instructions have to be issued as much as possible in parallel. 
<br>
<br>&bull; Superscalar architectures exploit the potential of instruction level parallelism present in the program. 
<br>&bull; An important feature of modern superscalar architectures is dynamic instruction scheduling: 
<br>- instructions are issued for execution dynamically, in parallel and out of order. 
<br>- out of order issuing: instructions are issued independent of their sequential order, based only on dependencies and availability of resources. 
<br><b>Results must be identical with those produced by strictly sequential execution. </b>
<br>
<br>&bull; Data dependencies have to be considered carefully
<br>&bull; Because of data dependencies, only some part of the instructions are potential subjects for parallel execution. 
<br>
<br>&bull; In order to find instructions to be issued in parallel, the processor has to select from a sufficiently large instruction sequence. 
<br>
<br>&bull; A large window of executionis needed
