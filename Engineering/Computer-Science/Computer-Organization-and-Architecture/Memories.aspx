<br>
<br>&bull; The main memory is used to store the program and data which are currently manipulated by the CPU. 
<br>&bull; The secondary memory provides the long-term storage of large amounts of data and program. 
<br>&bull; Before the data and program in the secondary memory can be manipulated by the CPU, they must first be loaded into the main memory. 
<br>&bull; The most important characteristics of a memory is its speed, size, and cost, which are mainly constrained by the technology used for its implementation. 
<br>&bull; Typically 
<br>- the main memory is fast and of limited size; 
<br>- secondary memory is relatively slow and of very large size. 
<br><b>The Main Memory </b>
<br><sub><img src="/Engineering/Computer-Science/Computer-Organization-and-Architecture/img_memories/image1.jpeg"></sub>
<br>&bull; The main memory can be viewed as a set of storage cells, each of which can be used to store a word. 
<br>&bull; Each cell is assigned a unique address and the addresses are numbered sequentially: 0,1,2,... . &bull; Besides the storage cells, there are a memory address buffer (storing the address of the word to be read/written) and a data buffer (storing the data read/to be written), the address decoder and a memory control unit. 
<br>&bull; The most widely used technology to implement main memories is semiconductor memories. 
<br>&bull; The most common semiconductor memory type is random access memory (RAM). 
<br>&bull; The information stored in a RAM semiconductor memory will be lost when electrical power is removed. 
<br><b>Secondary Memory </b>
<br><b>Hard Disk: </b>
<br>&bull; Data are recorded on the surface of a hard disk made of metal coated with magnetic material. 
<br>&bull; The disks and the drive are usually built together and encased in an air tight container to protect the disks from pollutants such as smoke particle and dust. Several disks are usually stacked on a common drive shaft with each disk having its own read/write head. 
<br>&bull; Main features: 
<br>- Direct access 
<br>- Fast access: 
<br>seek time &#8776 10 ms 
<br>data transfer rate &#8776 5 MB/s 
<br>- Large storage capacity (8MB - several GB) 
<br><b>Diskette: </b>
<br>&bull; Data are recorded on the surface of a floppy disk made of polyester coated with magnetic material. 
<br>&bull; A special diskette drive must be used to access data stored in the floppy disk. It works much like a record turntable of gramophone. 
<br>&bull; Main features: 
<br>- Direct access 
<br>- Cheap 
<br>- Portable, convenient to use 
<br>&bull; Main standards: 
<br>- 5 1/4-inch. Capacity &#8776 360 KB/disk 
<br>- 3 1/2-inch. Capacity &#8776 1.44 MB/disk 
<br>(about 700 pages of A4 text) 
<br><b>Magnetic tape: </b>
<br>&bull; Magnetic tape is made up from a layer of plastic which is coated with iron oxide. The oxide can be magnetized in different directions to represent data. 
<br>&bull; Its operation uses a similar principle as in the case of a tape recorder. 
<br>&bull; Main features: 
<br>- Sequential access (access time about 1-5 s) 
<br>- High value of storage (50 MB/tape) 
<br>- Inexpensive 
<br>&bull; It is often used for backup or archive purpose. 
<br><b>Optical Memory:</b> 
<br>&bull; CD-ROM (Compact Disk ROM): The disk surface is imprinted with microscopic holes which record digital information. When a low-powered laser beam shines on the surface, the intensity of the reflected light changes as it encounters a hole. The change is detected by a photosensor and converted into a digital signal. 
<br>- huge capacity: 775 MB/disk(Â»550 diskettes). 
<br>- inexpensive replication, cheap production. 
<br>- removable. 
<br>- read-only. 
<br>- long access time (could be half a second). 
<br>&bull; WORM (Write-Once Read-Many) CD: A laser beam of modest intensity equipped in the disk drive is used to imprint the hole pattern. 
<br>- good for archival storage by providing a permanent record of large volumes of data. 
<br>&bull; Erasable Optical Disk: combination of laser technology and magnetic surface technique. 
<br>- can be repeatedly written and overwritten 
<br>- high reliability and longer life than magnetic disks.
