<br><b>73. When will you call a cylinder as thin cylinder?</b>
<br>
<br>A cylinder is called as a thin cylinder when the ratio of wall thickness to the diameter of cylinder is less 1/20. 
<br>
<br><b>74. In a thin cylinder will the radial stress vary over the thickness of wall?</b>
<br>
<br>No, in thin cylinders radial stress developed in its wall is assumed to be constant. 
<br>since the wall thickness is very small as compared to the diameter of cylinder. 
<br>

<br><b>76. What is the effect of riveting a thin cylindrical shell?</b>
<br>
<br>Riveting reduces the area offering the resistance. Due to this, the circumferential and longitudinal stresses are more. It reduces the pressure carrying capacity of the shell. 
<br>
<br><b>77. What do you understand by the term wire winding of thin cylinder?</b>
<br>
<br>In order to increase the tensile strength of a thin cylinder to withstand high internal pressure without excessive increase in wall thickness, they are sometimes pre stressed by winding with a steel wire under tension. 
<br>
<br><b>78. What are the types of stresses setup in the thin cylinders?</b>
<br>
<br>1. Circumferential stresses (or) hoop stresses
<br>2. Longitudinal stresses 
<br>
<br><b>79. Define - hoop stress?</b>
<br>
<br>The stress is acting in the circumference of the cylinder wall (or) the stresses induced perpendicular to the axis of cylinder. 
<br>
<br><b>80. Define- longitudinal stress?</b>
<br>
<br>The stress is acting along the length of the cylinder is called longitudinal stress. 
<br>
<br><b>81. A thin cylinder of diameter d is subjected to internal pressure </b><b>p .</b><b> Write down the expression for hoop stress and longitudinal stress.</b>
<br>
<br>Hoop stress
<br>σ<sub>h</sub>=pd/2t
<br>Longitudinal stress
<br>σ<sub>l</sub>=pd/4t
<br>p- Pressure (gauge)
<br>d- Diameter
<br>t- Thickness
<br>
<br>
<br><b>82. State principle plane.</b>
<br>
<br>The planes, which have no shear stress, are known as principal planes. These planes carry only normal stresses. 
<br>
<br><b>83. Define principle stresses and principle plane.</b>
<br>
<br>Principle stress: The magnitude of normal stress, acting on a principal plane is known as principal stresses.
<br>Principle plane: The planes, which have no shear stress, are known as principal planes. 
<br>
<br><b>84. What is the radius of Mohr's circle?</b>
<br>
<br>Radius of Mohr's circle is equal to the maximum shear stress. 
<br>
<br><b>85. What is the use of Mohr's circle?</b>
<br>
<br>To find out the normal, resultant stresses and principle stress and their planes. 
<br>
<br><b>86. List the methods to find the stresses in oblique plane?</b>
<br>
<br>1. Analytical method
<br>2. Graphical method 
<br>
<br><b>87. A bar of cross sectional area 600 mm</b><b><sup>2</b></sup><b> is subjected to a tensile load of 50 KN applied at each end. Determine the normal stress on a plane inclined at 30&#176; to the direction of loading.</b>
<br>
<br>A = 600 mm<sup>2</sup>
<br>Load, P = 50KN
<br>θ = 30&#176;
<br>Stress, σ = Load/Area
<br>= 50*102/600
<br>= 83.33 N/mm<sup>2</sup>
<br>Normal stress, σ<sub>n</sub> = σ cos2θ
<br>= 83.33*cos2*30&#176;
<br>= 62.5 N/mm<sup>2</sup> 
<br>
<br><b>88. In case of equal like principle stresses, what is the diameter of the Mohr's circle?</b>
<br>
<br>Answer: Zero 
<br>
<br><b>89. Derive an expression for the longitudinal stress in a thin cylinder subjected to a uniform internal fluid pressure.</b>
<br>
<br>Force due to fluid pressure = p x &prod;/4 xd<sup>2</sup>
<br>Force due to longitudinal stress = f<sub>2</sub> x &prod;d x t
<br>p x &prod;/4 xd<sup>2</sup> = f<sub>2</sub> x &prod;d x t
<br>f<sub>2</sub> = 4t 
<br>
<br><b>90.In thin spherical shell, volumetric strain is -------- times the circumferential strain.</b>
