<br><b>33. In which point the bending moment is </b><b>maximum</b><b>?</b>
<br>
<br>When the shear force change of sign or the shear force is zero 
<br>
<br><b>34. Write the assumption in the theory of simple bending?</b>
<br>
<br>1. The material of the beam is homogeneous and isotropic.
<br>2. The beam material is stressed within the elastic limit and thus obey hooke's law.
<br>3. The transverse section which was plane before bending remains plains after bending also.
<br>4. Each layer of the beam is free to expand or contract independently about the layer, above or below.
<br>5. The value of E is the same in both compression and tension. 
<br>
<br><b>35. Write the theory of simple bending equation?</b>
<br>
<br>M/ I = F/Y = E/R
<br>M - Maximum bending moment
<br>I - Moment of inertia
<br>F - Maximum stress induced
<br>Y - Distance from the neutral axis
<br>E - Young's modulus
<br>R - Constant. 
<br>
<br><b>36. What types of stresses are caused in a beam subjected to a constant shear </b><b>force ?</b>
<br>
<br>Vertical and horizontal shear stress 
<br>
<br><b>37. State the main assumptions while deriving the general formula for shear stresses</b>
<br>
<br>The material is homogeneous, isotropic and elastic
<br>The modulus of elasticity in tension and compression are same.
<br>The shear stress is constant along the beam width
<br>The presence of shear stress does not affect the distribution of bending stress. 
<br>
<br><b>38. Define: Shear stress distribution</b>
<br>
<br>The variation of shear stress along the depth of the beam is called shear stress distribution 
<br>
<br><b>39. What is the ratio of maximum shear stress to the average shear stress for the rectangular section?</b>
<br>
<br>Qmax is 1.5 times the Qavg. 
<br>
<br><b>40. What is the ratio of maximum shear stress to the average shear stress in the case of solid circular section?</b>
<br>
<br>Qmax is 4/3 times the Qavg. 
<br>
<br><b>41. What is the maximum value of shear stress for triangular section?</b>
<br>
<br>Qmax=Fh2/12I
<br>h- Height
<br>F-load 
<br>
<br><b>42. What is the shear stress distribution value of Flange portion of the I-section?</b>
<br>
<br>q= f/2I * (D2/4 - y) D-depth y- Distance from neutral axis 
<br>
<br><b>43. What is the value of maximum of minimum shear stress in a rectangular cross section?</b>
<br>
<br>Qmax=3/2 * F/ (bd)
