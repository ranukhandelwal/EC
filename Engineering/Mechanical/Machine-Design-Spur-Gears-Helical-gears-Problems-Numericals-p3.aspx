<br><b>Unit-1 Spur Gears &amp; Helical gears</b> <i>Objective: It gives the basic knowledge about the principles of Spur &amp; cross helical Gear design on the basis of static load, dynamic load, wear etc.</i> 
<br><b>Mini Project Problems</b> 
<br>Spur gear problems 
<br>In the following problems, assume that :
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - gears with any tooth number up to 120 are procurable ( constraints are more severe in practice)
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - all gears are of steel, to the 20 degree full depth system unless otherwise indicated 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - mid-range profile shifts apply, where relevant. 
<br>
<br>The program Steel Spur Gears should be used to assist solution of asterisked problems, and may be used to check longhand solution of other fatigue problems. 
<br>1. Tooth numbers of certain gears in the epicyclic train are indicated; all gears are of the same module. Gear A rotates at 1000 rev/min clockwise while E rotates anticlockwise at 500 rev/min. Determine the speed and direction of rotation of the ring-gear D and of the arm shaft F. If the power output through each of D and F is 1 kW, what are the power transfers through A and E? [ 371 rev/min anticlockwise; 40 rev/min clockwise; 8.77 kW input; 6.77 kW output.

<br>
<br>
<br>2. The arm of the epicyclic train is driven clockwise at 1450 rev/min by a 5 kW motor. What torque is necessary to lock the 33 teeth gear? What is the speed of the 31 tooth gear? Note the reduction[ 16.3 kNm clockwise, 2.92 rev/min clockwise ]

<br>3. The sun wheels A and D are integral with the input shaft of the compound epicyclic gear illustrated, and the annular wheel C is fixed. The planet wheel B rotates freely on an axle carried by the annular wheel F, and the planet E on an axle mounted on the output shaft's arm. Given the tooth numbers indicated, find the speed of the output shaft when the input shaft rotates at 1000 rev/min. 
<br>Ans=524rev/min 
<br><sub><img src="/Engineering/Mechanical/img_machine-design-spur-gears-helical-gears-problems-numericals-p3/image3.jpeg"></sub>
<br>4. In the epicyclic train illustrated, the gear C is fixed and the compound planet BD revolves freely on a spindle which is coaxial with the input and output shafts. 
<br>(a) Show that if z<sub>b</sub> z<sub>e</sub> &gt; z<sub>c</sub> z<sub>d</sub> then input and output shafts rotate in the same direction. 
<br>(b) 7.5 kW is fed into the input shaft at 500 rev/min, losses are negligible, and tooth numbers are sketched. Determine the torque on the output shaft. 
<br>Ans=15.5kNm

<br>5. Select spur gears suitable for speed ratios of (i) 1/√2, and (ii) &prod; , to four significant figures. 
<br>
<br>6. Determine the practical limits of profile shift on a 6 mm module gear with 19 teeth. If a profile shift of 0.4 is implemented, what are the dedendum, base, pitch, extended pitch and addendum circle diameters of the gear ? 
<br>Evaluate the base pitch and the angle γ of Fig A. 
<br>[ 103.8, 107.1, 114, 118.8 and 130.8 mm. 17.7 mm, 6.47<sup>o</sup>] 
<br>
<br>7. What is the practical range of centre distance for a pair of 4 mm module spur gears with 19 and 35 teeth ? If they are manufactured with profile shifts of 1.5 mm and 2 mm respectively, evaluate the extended pressure angle and the contact ratio. 
<br>[ 108.6 &#8804; C &#8804; 112.8 mm, 24.47<sup>o</sup>, 1.42 ] 
<br>
<br>8. Use the design procedure outlined in the Notes to determine gears suitable for a speed ratio of √ 2 &#177; 0.5 % and a centre distance of 200 &#177; 1 mm. 
<br>[ 6 mm module, with 27 and 38 teeth, and profile shifts of 0.45 say, for pinion and correspondingly 0.38 for wheel ] 
<br>
<br>9. Evaluate the contact ratio and the fatigue geometric factors I and J for each of the following : 
<br>(a) the pairs 13:35, 23:62 and 36:97 (which approximate the ratio 0.3711 to within 0.1%); 
<br>(b)* 23:62 teeth, assuming the minimum practical profile shifts for both gears; 
<br>(c)* repeat (b) but use the maximum practical profile shifts. Comment upon the trends suggested by these results. 
<br>
<br>10. The transmission accuracy level number of a pair of open gears is 6. Further particulars of the 25 mm module 300 mm facewidth gears are as follows : <Table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bordercolor="#c4c4c4">

<br>12. Two mating gears of commercial quality are to hand with 18 and 56 teeth. Their common facewidth is measured as 50 mm and their addendum diameters as 83.2 and 233.6 mm.
