<br><b>56. What is a spring?</b>
<br>
<br>A spring is an elastic member, which deflects, or distorts under the action of load and regains its original shape after the load is removed. 
<br>
<br><b>57. State any two functions of springs.</b>
<br>
<br>1 . To measure forces in spring balance, meters and engine indicators.
<br>2 . To store energy. 
<br>
<br><b>58. What are the various types of springs?</b>
<br>
<br>i. Helical springs
<br>ii. Spiral springs
<br>iii. Leaf springs
<br>iv. Disc spring or Belleville springs 
<br>
<br><b>59. Classify the helical springs.</b>
<br>
<br>1. Close - coiled or tension helical spring.
<br>2. Open -coiled or compression helical spring. 
<br>
<br><b>60. What is spring index (C)?</b>
<br>
<br>The ratio of mean or pitch diameter to the diameter of wire for the spring is called the spring index. 
<br>
<br><b>61. What is solid length?</b>
<br>
<br>The length of a spring under the maximum compression is called its solid length. It is the product of total number of coils and the diameter of wire.
<br>Ls = n<sub>t</sub> x d
<br>Where, n<sub>t</sub> = total number of coils. 
<br>
<br><b>62. Define free length.</b>
<br>
<br>Free length of the spring is the length of the spring when it is free or unloaded condition. It is equal to the solid length plus the maximum deflection or compression plus clash allowance.
<br>Lf = solid length + Y<sub>max</sub> + 0.15 Y<sub>max</sub> 
<br>
<br><b>63. Define spring rate (stiffness).</b>
<br>
<br>The spring stiffness or spring constant is defined as the load required per unit deflection of the spring.
<br>K= W/y
<br>Where W -load
<br>Y - deflection 
<br>
<br><b>64. Define pitch.</b>
<br>
<br>Pitch of the spring is defined as the axial distance between the adjacent coils in uncompressed state. Mathematically
<br>Pitch=free length / n-1 
<br>
<br><b>65. Define helical springs.</b>
<br>
<br>The helical springs are made up of a wire coiled in the form of a helix and is primarily intended for compressive or tensile load 
<br>
<br><b>66. What are the differences between closed coil &amp; open coil helical springs?</b><Table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bordercolor="#c4c4c4">

    <tr>

      
      <td class="txt">
	<br>The spring wires are coiled very closely, each turn is nearly at right angles to the axis of helix</td>

      
      <td class="txt">
	<br>The wires are coiled such that there is a gap between the two consecutive turns.</td>
</tr>

    <tr>

      
      <td class="txt">
<br>Helix angle is less than 10<sup>o</sup>
</td>

      
      <td class="txt">
	<br>Helix angle is large (&gt;10<sup>o</sup>)
</td>
</tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>67. What are the stresses induced in the helical compression spring due to axial load?</b>
<br>
<br>1. Direct shear stress
<br>2. Torsional shear stress
<br>3. Effect of curvature 
<br>
<br><b>68. What is buckling of springs?</b>
<br>
<br>The helical compression spring behaves like a column and buckles at a comparative small load when the length of the spring is more than 4 times the mean coil diameter. 
<br>
<br><b>69. What is surge in springs?</b>
<br>
<br>The material is subjected to higher stresses, which may cause early fatigue failure. This effect is called as spring surge. 
<br>
<br><b>70. Define active turns.</b>
<br>
<br>Active turns of the spring are defined as the number of turns, which impart spring action while loaded. As load increases the no of active coils decreases. 
<br>
<br><b>71. Define inactive turns.</b>
<br>
<br>An inactive turn of the spring is defined as the number of turns which does not contribute to the spring action while loaded. As load increases number of inactive coils increases from 0.5 to 1 turn. 
<br>
<br><b>72. What are the different kinds of end connections for compression helical springs?</b>
<br>
<br>The different kinds of end connection for compression helical springs are
<br>a. Plain ends
<br>b. Ground ends
<br>c. Squared ends
<br>d. Ground &amp; square ends
