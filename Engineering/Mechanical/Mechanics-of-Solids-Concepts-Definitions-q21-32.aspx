<br><b>21. Define point of contra flexure? In which beam it occurs?</b>
<br>
<br>Point at which BM changes to zero is point of contra flexure. It occurs in overhanging beam. 
<br>
<br><b>22. What is mean by positive or sagging BM?</b>
<br>
<br>BM is said to positive if moment on left side of beam is clockwise or right side of the beam is counter clockwise. 
<br>
<br><b>23. What is mean by negative or hogging BM?</b>
<br>
<br>BM is said to negative if moment on left side of beam is counterclockwise or right side of the beam is clockwise. 
<br>
<br><b>24. Define shear force and bending moment?</b>
<br>
<br>SF at any cross section is defined as algebraic sum of all the forces acting either side of beam. BM at any cross section is defined as algebraic sum of the moments of all the forces which are placed either side from that point. 
<br>
<br><b>25. What is meant by transverse loading of beam?</b>
<br>
<br>If load is acting on the beam which is perpendicular to center line of it is called transverse loading of beam. 
<br>
<br><b>26. When will bending moment is </b><b>maximum</b><b>?</b>
<br>
<br>BM will be maximum when shear force change its sign. 
<br>
<br><b>27. What is maximum bending moment in a simply supported beam of span ‘L' subjected to UDL of ‘w' over entire span</b>
<br>
<br>Max BM =wL2/8 
<br>
<br><b>28. In a simply supported beam how will you locate point of maximum bending moment?</b>
<br>
<br>The bending moment is max. when SF is zero. Write SF equation at that point and equating to zero we can find out the distances ‘x' from one end .then find maximum bending moment at that point by taking all moment on right or left hand side of beam. 
<br>
<br><b>29. What is shear force?</b>
<br>
<br>The algebric sum of the vertical forces at any section of the beam to the left or right of the section is called shear force. 
<br>
<br><b>30. What is shear force and bending moment diagram?</b>
<br>
<br>It shows the variation of the shear force and bending moment along the length of the beam. 
<br>
<br><b>31. What are the types of beams?</b>
<br>
<br>1. Cantilever beam
<br>2. Simply supported beam
<br>3. Fixed beam
<br>4. Continuous beam
<br>
<br>
<br><b>32. What are the types of loads?</b>
<br>
<br>1. Concentrated load or point load
<br>2. Uniform distributed load
<br>3. Uniform varying load
