<br><b>11. Give the relationship between Bulk Modulus and Young's Modulus.</b>
<br>
<br>E = 3K (1-2/m) Where, E - Young's Modulus K - Bulk Modulus 1/m - Poisson's ratio 
<br>
<br><b>12. Define- Rigidity modulus</b>
<br>The shear stress is directly proportional to shear strain. N = Shear stress Shear strain 
<br>
<br><b>13. What is compound bar?</b>
<br>A composite bar composed of two or more different materials joined together such that system is elongated or compressed in a single unit. 
<br>
<br><b>14. What you mean by thermal stresses?</b>
<br>If the body is allowed to expand or contract freely, with the rise or fall of temperature no stress is developed but if free expansion is prevented the stress developed is called temperature stress or strain. 
<br>
<br><b>15. Define- elastic limit</b>
<br>Some external force is acting on the body, the body tends to deformation. If the force is released from the body its regain to the original position. This is called elastic limit 
<br>
<br><b>16. Define â€“ Young's modulus</b>
<br>The ratio of stress and strain is constant with in the elastic limit.
<br>E = Stress / Strain 
<br>
<br><b>17. Define Bulk-modulus</b>
<br>The ratio of direct stress to volumetric strain.
<br>K = Direct stress / Volumetric strain 
<br>
<br><b>18. Define- lateral strain</b>
<br>When a body is subjected to axial load P. The length of the body is increased. The axial deformation of the length of the body is called lateral strain. 
<br>
<br><b>19. Define- longitudinal strain</b>
<br>The strain right angle to the direction of the applied load is called lateral strain. 
<br>
<br><b>20. What is principle of super position?</b>
<br>The resultant deformation of the body is equal to the algebric sum of the deformation of the individual section. Such principle is called as principle of super position
