<br><b>2. Selection for a Particular Circle &amp; Service liability</b>
<br>The BSNL comprises a number of territorial Circles and functional Circles. The recruitment will be made centrally by BSNL and JTOs so recruited will be allotted territorial/functional Circles depending on vacancies, their choice and merit. A list of the existing territorial Circles, their respective headquarters etc., appears in Annexure ‘A'.
<br>
<br>The Junior Telecom Officer is a Circle-based Cadre and the candidates would be selected against the vacancies in a particular Circle and required to serve minimum of 5 years in that particular Circle only or until they are promoted to All India Cadre, whichever is earlier. However, the officers are liable to be transferred anywhere in India in the interest of service. Applicants shall have the option to be considered for a particular Circle [out of Annexure ‘A.' Circles] of his/her choice in order of preference given by him/her in the application for examination. Option once exercised shall be final. Change of Circle afterwards would not be allowed. The applicants should exercise their option very carefully and indicate their choice of Circles in order of their preference. Applicants may opt for 5 [Five] Circles in order of their preference from amongst the Circles at Annexure-‘A'. If applicants have opted for 5 Circles in order of their preference then applicants shall give “Any where in India” as their sixth choice but if the number of Circles opted in order of their preference is less than 5 then one of option shall be “Any where in India”. In case it is not possible to accommodate them in any of the Circles of their choice, they shall be posted to any of the Circles where vacancies are available.
<br>A successful applicant will, however, get appointment in the Circle of choice strictly depending upon his/her position in the merit-list drawn on the basis of his/her performance in the All India competitive examination and the number of vacancies available in the Circles. In case an applicant does not indicate his/her preference of Circle, he/she will be allotted the Circle wherever the vacancies remain unfilled irrespective of his/her position in the merit-list solely as per requirements of BSNL.
<br>
<br>The above notwithstanding, BSNL has, however, the right to post any selected J.T.O. to any of the Circles either temporarily or on permanent basis. The decision of BSNL in this regard shall be final and binding. The service conditions, seniority etc. of selected candidates will be determined as per prevailing rules of the Corporation from time to time.
