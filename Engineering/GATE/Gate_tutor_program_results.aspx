<br>Hi All,
<br>I have started sending selection mails for GATE TUTOR PROGRAM. Selected candidates will receive mail to be replied by them. If candidate don't reply in time, I will send one reminder to them after this chance will be given to next candidate.
<br>
<br><b>Can I still send request to join program</b>
<br>As you are aware you can send request for participation till 5th Sep'2009. So if you wish to participate in GATE TUTOR PRAGRAM and have not sent request till now then do it now. I'm not considering any request which is incomplete.
<br><asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" Text="Click here to see selection form" NavigateUrl="~/engineering/gate/gate_tutor_is_guiding_50_students.aspx"></asp:HyperLink>
<br><b>How will I know if I'm selected?</b>
<br>Selected candidates will get mail from gate.tutor@gmail.com - add this id in your contact list. 
<br>Selected Candidates have to accept terms and conditions of the program and need to send acceptance mail in response to my invitation mail. 
<br>
<br>Below are extracts from the mail to give you insight of the program.
<br><b>About Program</b>
<br>
<br>GATE TUTOR PROGRAM is divided into two parts
<br>1) Best Method of Exam Preparation - Post Engineering
<br>2) Study Material and Query resolution program - Post Engineering
<br>
<br><b>Best Method of Exam Preparation</b> will be an online program where 50 students are selected. The selection of these candidates is purely on the basis of their response to <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink2" runat="server" Text="GATE TUTOR questionnaire." NavigateUrl="~/engineering/gate/gate_tutor_is_guiding_50_students.aspx"></asp:HyperLink>
<br>
<br><b>How it works?</b>
<br>
<br>1) You (selected candidate) will be interacted frequently by GATE TUTOR for various queries regarding your exam preparation method. These queries/questions will help the system understand you better. 
<br>2) These queries/questions will help you self appraise your methods of exam preparation. You will start analyzing good and weak points in your method
<br>3) Above activities will equip you with many questions to judge reasons for your earlier failures or success.
<br>4) Your and other selected candidate's response will be posted on ExamCrazy.Com website for queries, feedbacks and responses.
<br>5) I (GATE TUTOR) and other professors can also question you for your style and suggest you where ever we feel
<br>6) You can always review the methods &amp; techniques of other students and can post your own queries/feedbacks for them.
<br>7) After a period of analysis, feedbacks and reviews we come to a common conclusion for each candidate. 
<br>
<br><b>What is expected from you?</b>
<br>1) Active participation and regular feedbacks for the evolution of the system.
<br>
<br>Note: No method for exam preparation is wrong or full proof. You are the best judge of your method. This program will make you understand other's methods and cross questions/queries/feedback will help you evolve your method. 
<br>
