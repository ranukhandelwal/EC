<br>Hi All,
<br>First of all thank you all for responding to GATE TUTOR program. I'm grateful for overwhelming response.
<br>
<br>Let me tell you current progress, I'm reading each response and selecting users based on responses. Next I'll be contacting selected students and will start program soon. In between others can also send their response till 5th Sep(teachers day) 
<br>
<br><b>But something is confusing me??</b> 
<br>
<br>1) As I mentioned my intention for this program was to help selected students in improving their methods of studying. I wished to work with them to find out best method for them. Students history in last exams etc is never my concern. And I never asked this information. As per me hard work and correct method is key to success.
<br>2) While reading responses from you all and other mails it seems students are expecting help in solution of their subject questions too. I'm planning to start such a program too.
<br>3) My next concern especially after reading responses and other mails is should I help only 50 students or larger society and how. Helping some limited students is easy but I want to work on some method to help most of you(of course for free) 
<br>
<br><b>So how to proceed?</b> 
<br>
<br>My idea is to first start program for study methodology and then program to solve students query. 
<br>
<br>I think following can be feasible
<br>1) As planned I select 50 students based on different studying styles. Make this program online and let all other students participate in this program. For sure I'll protect personnel information as phone number, email address of students.
<br>2) In between start preparing another program to help you all with questions/difficulties in subjects. Starting such a program is big job. Probably I need some volunteers among you all. If any one is willing for volunteers please mail me at gate.tutor@gmail.com. I'll need help of volunteers in ideas and other activities. 
<br>
<br><b>Issues in responses</b> 
<br>
<br>I found many responses were not complete. Please understand, I'll not be able to help if your responses are not proper and lot of my time is wasted in this. Please fill form properly before sending it to me. 
<br>
<br><b>Please mail me for following</b>
<br>
<br>1) To participate in program, your responses to my questions. <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" Text="Click here for questions." NavigateUrl="~/engineering/gate/gate_tutor_is_guiding_50_students.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> Please stick to guidelines.
<br>2) Interested volunteers please mail me. Please keep voulanteer in subject of mail. Please mail me time you can spend and how you can help this program.
<br>
<br>I'm looking for feedbacks and new ideas. Use comments section below for this.
