<br>Preparing for GATE can be as easy as preparing for your college examinations. Just take little cautions while studying any topic and do remember that GATE paper focus on your in depth knowledge of subject, your basics, presence of mind during examination etc.

<br><sub><img src="/Engineering/GATE/img_how-to-prepare-best-recommended-books-gate-preparation/image1.gif"></sub>Â  Don't worry if your percentage in university exams is low as GATE admissions do not consider them. Just maintain minimum percentage required by many colleges including IIT's. Look at <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink6" runat="server" Text="GATE Cutoff and eligibility" NavigateUrl="~/engineering/gate/previous-year-admission-cut-offs-gate-iit.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> section to know eligibility and cut off of various colleges.
<br><sub><img src="/Engineering/GATE/img_how-to-prepare-best-recommended-books-gate-preparation/image1.gif"></sub>&nbsp; <b>Group study</b> is one of the best ways of preparation. Divide sections/topics between you and your partner and have a brief session on topic from your friend before you actually start topic. This will save your time and efforts and will improve your and your partner's understanding on the topic.
<br><sub><img src="/Engineering/GATE/img_how-to-prepare-best-recommended-books-gate-preparation/image1.gif"></sub>&nbsp; Normally coaching GATE is not required but if you are not able to concentrate much then this is a good option.
