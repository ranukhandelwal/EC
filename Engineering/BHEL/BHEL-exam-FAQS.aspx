<br><b>I have appeared for my final Semester/Year Examinations and the results are yet to be announced. Am I eligible to apply? </b>
<br>Only those candidates who have already passed the qualifying exam and &amp; have the final marks sheet available with them at the time of filling the application are eligible to apply. As such candidate having passed their Engineering Degree upto 20th September, 2010, before submission of application, are eligible to apply. 
<br>
<br><b>I have studied AMIE and then completed my ME in Mechanical engineering. Am I eligible to apply against this advertisement? </b>
<br>For the post of Engineer Trainees, qualifications prescribed stipulate full time regular Bachelor's degree in Engineering or Technology from a recognised University/ Institute. In view of this, AMIE qualification does not fulfil our requirement and as such, you are not eligible to apply. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>I have a BE/B Tech degree in Metallurgy. But this specialisation has not been advertised. Can I apply against Mechanical Engineering for the post of ET?</b>
<br>We regret that for the post of Engineer Trainee- Mechanical Engineering candidates with Metallurgy Engineering are not eligible similarly candidates having engineering degree in disciplines other than specified (or considered equivalent) as given in this website are not eligible. 
<br>
<br><b>In my Degree Course only CGPA / GPA / SGPA or letter grade has been awarded in place of percentage of marks. Can I enter the grade in my application? </b>
<br>Candidates, who have been awarded CGPA / GPA / SGPA or letter grades, should convert the grades to % and provide only the equivalent percentage of marks in the application form.
<br>
<br><b>My aggregate % of marks in Engineering as given in my final year marksheet provided by my college is 79.38%. However when I fill my year-wise marks in BHEL's online application form, my percentages as computed by the system comes to 77.5%. Explain the discrepancy? </b>
<br>It is reiterated that as per BHEL job-specifications, the aggregate of marks of all years/ semesters means average of marks/ GPA of all the years/ semesters without taking into account the weightage, if any, given to any particular year/ semester by the Institute or University. This is explained below : <Table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" bordercolor="#c4c4c4">
