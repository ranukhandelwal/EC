<br><b>Q11. Explain construction and principle of operation of dynamometer type instrument. Why is this instrument suitable for both AC and DC measurements? </b><b>
<br></b><b>
<br>Answer. ANSWER NEED TO BE VERIFIED</b> 
<br>
<br>Dynamometer type instruments are very similar to PMMC instrument except that the permanent magnetic field is replaced by a coil which carry the current to be measured. The coil are usually air-cored to avoid hysterisis, eddy currents and other errors when the instrument is used on dc. The fixed coil divided into two parts connected in series with the moving coil and placed together and parallel to each so as to provide a fairly uniform field within the range of the movement of the two halves of the fixed coil must be sufficient enough to allow the movement to moving coil shaft. The instrument develops deflecting torque by the interaction of magnetic field, one field due to current in a moving coil and the other due to current in the fixed coil is not constant but varies with the magnitude of current flowing through the fixed coil. Hence the deflecting torque of this instrument is determined not only by the moving coil current but also by the fixed coil current and due to it's this properly. This is determined not only by moving coil. This is a versatile measuring device for several other applications such as for measurment of power, reactive volt amperes and with some modifications for measuring power factor and frequency in ac circuit. Hence it can be used for measuring AC as well as DC.
