<br><b>Q14. Explain the principle of operation of attraction type moving iron instruments and explain how the controlling and damping forces are obtained? </b><b>
<br></b><b>
<br>Answer. ANSWER NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED</b> 
<br>
<br>The earliest and simplest form of attraction moving iron instruments uses a solenoid and moving oval shaped soft iron pinoted eccentrically. To this iron a pointer is attached so that it may deflect along with the moving iron over a graduate scale. The iron is made of sheet metal specially shaped to give a scale as nearby uniform as possible. The moving iron is drawn into field of solenoid when current flows through it. The movement of the iron always from weaker magnetic field outside the coil into the stronger field inside the coil regardless the direction of flow of current. When the current to be measured is passed through the solenoid, a magnetic field is set up inside the solenoid, which in turn magnetises the iron. Thus the iron is attached into the coil causing the spindle and the pointer to rotate. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So much instruments normally have spring control and pneumatic damping forces.
