<br><b>Q8. Explain the working principle of induction type wattmeter with the help of diagram?</b><b>
<br>Answer. ANSWER NEED TO BE VERIFIED</b>
<br>
<br>Induction type wattmeter consists of two laminate electromagnets known as shunt electromagnet and series electromagnet respectively. Shunt magnet is excited by the current proportional to the voltage across load flowing through the pressure coil and series magnet is excited by the current, proportional to the voltage across the load flowing through the pressure coil and series magnet is excited by the load current flowing through the current coil. A thin disc made of Cu or Al, pivoted at its centre, is placed between the shunt and series magnets so that it cuts the flux from both of the magnets. The deflection torque is produced by interaction of eddy current induced in the disc and the inducing flux in order to cause the resultant flux in shunt magnet to lag in phase by exactly 90&#176; behind the applied voltage, one or more copper rings, known as copper shading bond are provided on one limb at the shunt magnet. Correct disppointed between shunt and series magnet fluxes may be attained by adjusting the position of copper shading bonds. 
<br>       The pressure coil circuit of introduction type instrument is made as inductive as possible so that the flux of the shunt magnet may lag by 90&#176; behind the applied voltage.
