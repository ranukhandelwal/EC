<br><b>Q6. Discuss the construction and working of an electrodynamic wattmeter with the help of diagram?</b><b>
<br>Answer. </b>
<br>This type of instrument is similar in design and principle to the dynanometer type ammeter and voltameter. 
<br>
<br>WORKING AND CONSTRUCTION:- When the instrument of this type is used as wattmeter, the fixed coil which is divided into two equal portions in order to provide them uniform field , is employed as current coil and moving coil is used as pressure coil. The fixed coil which is divided into two equal portion in order to provide them uniform field, is employed as current coil and the moving coil is used as pressure coil, i.e the fixed coil carries the current proportional to the voltage across the circuit. A high non inductive resistance is connected in series with the moving coil in order to limit current. The magnetic field of the fixed and moving coil react on one another causing the moving coil to turn about it's axis. The movement is controlled by hair springs which also leads the current into and out of the moving element. Damping is provided by light aluminium moving in an air dash pot. The pointer is fixed to the moving coil spindle and moves over a suitable caliberated scale. 
<br>
<br>THEORY:- Let us be the supply voltage, i the load current and R the load resistance of the moving coil circuit. 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current through fixed coil, i<sub>f</sub> = i 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Current through moving coil, i<sub>m</sub> = V/R 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; deflecting torque, T<sub>d</sub> ∝ i<sub>f</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; i<sub>m</sub> ∝ V/R 
<br>For a DC circuit the deflecting torque is thus proportional to the power and for any circuit with fluctuating torque. The instantaneous to the instantaneous power.
