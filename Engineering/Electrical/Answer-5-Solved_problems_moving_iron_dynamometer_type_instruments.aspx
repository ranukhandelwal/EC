<br><b>Q5. Briefly discuss the construction and working of a PMMC instrument. Why is the linear scale. How range is extended in moving coil ammeter and voltameter?</b><b>
<br>Answer. </b>Answer needs to be Verified.
<br>CONSTRUCTION:- In a permanent magnet with soft iron pole pieces, a cylindrical iron core is mounted between the two poles of the magnet giving very narrow air gap in which the sides of a pointted light rectangular coil lies. The rectangular coil is wound of many turns of coil. The purpose of using core is to make the field uniform and to reduce the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. A low reluctance helps to retain permeance of magnet for a longer period. 
<br>WORKING OF TORQUE EQUATION:- When the current to be measured is passed through the coil, say in the direction as shown in fig. (a), deflecting torque is produced. On account of relation between permanent magnetic field and coil magnetic field, the direction of deflecting torque can be determined by applying Fleming's left hand rule. 
<br>It is the current in amperes flowing through the coil of turns N and length l meters B is flux density in test as in air gap:- 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, deflecting force F = BilN newtons. 
<br>If r is the distance in meters in between the centers of the coil and force F. 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then deflecting torque T<sub>d</sub> = F x r = BilNr N<sub>m</sub> 
<br>From the above expression it is obvious that if flux density B in the air gap is constant, then 
<br>deflecting torque T<sub>d</sub> ∝ i , T<sub>c</sub>= T<sub>d</sub> 
<br>So, θ ∝ i 
<br>And since &theta; is directly proportional to current, the scale of the basic dc PMMC instrument are usually linearly spaced. Hence scale is linear.
