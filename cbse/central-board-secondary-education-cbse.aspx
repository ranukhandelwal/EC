	Central Board of Secondary Education 
	<br>The Central Board of Secondary Education is an eminent board of school education in India. The CBSE prepares the syllabus for Class 9 to Class 12 in schools affiliated with it. 
<br>
<br>It conducts two major examinations every year, the <b>All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE)</b> for Class 10 and the <b>All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE)</b> for Class 12, which is a school-leaving examination. Many private schools within and outside India are affiliated to CBSE. The medium for education prescribed by CBSE is either English or Hindi. 
<br>
<br>The CBSE also conducts the <asp:HyperLink ID="HyperLink1" runat="server" Text="<b>All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE)</b>" NavigateUrl="~/pre-engineering/aieee.aspx"></asp:HyperLink> which is a common entrance examination conducted on all-India basis for admission to engineering and architecture/planning programmes in the country. 
<br>Similarly <b>Pre-medical and Pre-dental Tests AIPMT (PMT/PDT)</b> are conducted for medical and dental colleges. 
<br>
<br>The jurisdiction of the Board is extensive and stretches beyond the national geographical boundaries. As a result of the reconstitution, the erstwhile ' Delhi Board of Secondary Education' was merged with the Central Board and thus all the educational institutions recognized by the Delhi Board also became a part of the Central Board . Subsequently, all the schools located in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Andaman and Nicobar Island, Arunachal Pradesh, the state of Sikkim , and now Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh have also got affiliation with the Board. From 309 schools in 1962 the Board today has 8979 schools on 31-03-2007 including 141 schools in 21 countries. There are 897 Kendriya Vidyalayas, 1761 Government Schools, 5827 Independent Schools, 480 Jawahar Novodaya Vidyalayas and 14 Central Tibetean Schools.
