<br><b>DIRECTIONS for questions 103 to 105: </b>These questions are based on the situation given below:
<br>
<br>A road network (shown in the figure below) connects cities A, B, C and D. All road segments are straight lines. D is the midpoint on the road connecting A and C. Roads AB and BC are at right angles to each other with BC shorter than AB. The segment AB is 100 km long.

<br>Ms. X and Mr. Y leave A at 8:00 am, take different routes to city C and reach at the same time. X takes the highway from A to B to C and travels at an average speed of 61.875 km per hour. Y takes the direct route AC and travels at 45 km per hour on segment AD. Y's speed on segment DC is 55 km per hour.

<br><b>DIRECTIONS for questions 106 and 107: </b>These questions are based on the situation given below:
<br>
<br>Rajiv reaches city B from city A in 4 hours, driving at the speed of 35 km per hour for the first 2 hours and at 45 km per hour for the next two hours. Aditi follows the same route, but drives at three different speeds: 30, 40 and 50 km per hour, covering an equal distance in each speed segment. The two cars are similar with petrol consumption characteristics (km per litre) shown in the figure below.
<br>
<br><b>106.</b> The amount of petrol consumed by Aditi for the journey is
<br>
<br>1. 8.3 litres
<br>2. 8.6 litres
<br>3. 8.9 litres
<br>4. 9.2 litres
<br>
<br><b>107.</b> Zoheb would like to drive Aditi's car over the same route from A to B and minimize the petrol consumption for the trip. The amount of petrol required by him is

<br><b>DIRECTIONS for questions 108 to 110: </b>These questions are based on the situation given below:
<br>
<br>Recently, Ghosh Babu spent his winter vacation on Kyakya Island. During the vacation, he visited the local casino where he came across a new card game. Two players, using a normal deck of 52 playing cards, play this game. One player is called the Dealer and the other is called the Player. First, the Player picks a card at random from the deck. This is called the base card. The amount in rupees equal to the face value of the base card is called the base amount. The face values of Ace, King, Queen and Jack are ten. For other cards, the face value is the number on the card. Once, the Player picks a card from the deck, the Dealer pays him the base amount. Then the dealer picks a card from the deck and this card is called the top card. If the top card is of the same suit as the base card, the Player pays twice the base amount to the Dealer. If the top card is of the same colour as the base card (but not the same suit) then the Player pays the base amount to the Dealer. If the top card happens to be of a different colour than the base card, the Dealer pays the base amount to the Player. 
<br>
<br>Ghosh Babu played the game 4 times. First time he picked eight of clubs and the Dealer picked queen of clubs. Second time, he picked ten of hearts and the dealer picked two of spades. Next time, Ghosh Babu picked six of diamonds and the dealer picked ace of hearts. Lastly, he picked eight of spades and the dealer picked jack of spades. Answer the following questions based on these four games.
<br>
<br><b>108.</b> If Ghosh Babu stopped playing the game when his gain would be maximized, the gain in Rs. would have been
<br>
<br>1. 12
<br>2. 20
<br>3. 16
<br>4. 4
<br>
<br><b>109.</b> The initial money Ghosh Babu had (before the beginning of the game sessions) was Rs. X. At no point did he have to borrow any money. What is the minimum possible value of X?
<br>
<br>1. 16
<br>2. 8
<br>3. 100
<br>4. 24
<br>
<br><b>110.</b> If the final amount of money that Ghosh Babu had with him was Rs. 100, what was the initial amount he had with him?
<br>
<br>1. 120
<br>2. 8
<br>3. 4
