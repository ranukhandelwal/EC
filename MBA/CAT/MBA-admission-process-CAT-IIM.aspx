<br><b>admission policy of iims</b>
<br>
<br>cat is conducted jointly by all iims. however, each iim follows its own admission process, independent of other iims. performance in cat is one of several inputs used by iims to judge suitability of candidate, first for group discussion and/or interview and then for final selection. each iim independently decides what weightages should be given to the various areas. admission process followed by each iim is given in the respective institutional profile. 
<br>
<br>candidates are short listed for the interview on the basis of their performance in the cat, scholastic achievement and relevant work experience. short listed candidates are sent application forms to formally apply to the post graduate program (pgp). once the formal applications are received, candidates are informed of the interview schedule. <b>interviews</b> are conducted at bangalore, calcutta, mumbai, and new delhi during the second half of march. 
<br>
<br>final selection is based on cat score, scholastic achievement, work experience, performance in the group discussion, interview, and three letters of reference. 
<br>
<br>note: <b>cat score</b> is but one of the inputs at every stage of the selection process. it is possible for a candidate with a lower cat score to be selected for interview and group discussion, and to be offered admission in preference to a candidate with a higher cat score on account of better performance in other criteria mentioned above. 
<br>
<br><b>non-iim institutes</b> 
<br>
<br>many institutes, other than the iims, also use cat scores for their admission process. iim conducting cat provides the scores of the candidates who have applied to them along with suggested guidelines on how to use the scores. iims do not have any role, other than providing cat scores, in the admission process of these institutes. 
<br>
<br>for most of the institutes other than iims, candidates have to buy the application forms and apply to them individually. please check the cat bulletin for details.
