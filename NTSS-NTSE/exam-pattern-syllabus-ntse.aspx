<br><b>Syllabus: </b>There is no defined syllabus for NTSE
<br>
<br><b>Exam Pattern:</b>
<br><b>Stage I</b> examination at the State/UT level will comprise two parts, namely (a) Mental Ability Test (MAT) and (b) Scholastic Ability Test (SAT) covering social sciences, sciences and mathematics.
<br><b>Stage II</b> examination at the National level will comprise (a) Mental Ability Test (MAT), (b) Scholastic Ability Test (SAT) covering social sciences, sciences and mathematics, (c) Interview. Only those candidates who qualify the written examination at the National Level will be invited for interview.
<br>
<br>- The SAT and MAT will have 100 items each in place of 90 items given in the NTS Scheme.
<br>- Each question will carry 1 mark. The total marks will be 100 for each test.
<br>- Minimum qualifying marks will be 40% i.e. 40 marks for general category.
<br>- Minimum qualifying marks for reserved categories will be 32% i.e. 32 marks.
<br>- The duration of the tests will remain the same i.e. 90 minutes each.
<br>- For first 90 questions in both SAT and MAT, the candidates have to put a cross mark (X) on the number of the correct alternative on the answer sheet against the corresponding question. For questions 91-100, the answers are to be written in the given space in the answer sheet.
<br>- In SAT the first 90 items are divided into three areas - 35 for Science, 20 for Mathematics and 35 for Social Science. However, no separate sections are given in the test. The last 10 questions are mixed from different subjects.
<br>
<br>
<br>Each question has four alternatives marked 1,2,3 and 4. The candidate has to select one correct answer from the given alternatives and mark its number in the answersheet. Each correct answer carries one mark. Thus the total score of a candidate in a test is equal to the number of questions answered correctly by him/her. 
<br>
<br><b>Mental Ability Test Items</b>
<br>This test is given to the candidates to judge their power of reasoning, ability to think, ability to judge, evaluate or discriminate, ability to visualize in the space, spatial orientation, etc. A variety of questions e.g. analogies, classification, series, pattern perception, hidden figures, coding-decoding, block assembly, problem solving etc. are used for this purpose. To acquaint the candidates with such questions, some examples are given below. The rationale to find the answer to each question is given at the end. The candidates are advised to try to solve these questions themselves first. Later on, they may look at the solutions to find their correct answer and the rationale. 
<br>
<br><b>Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT</b><b>)</b>
<br>
<br>Below are given sample questions on SAT in different subjects. These questions are basically multiple-choice questions where one alternative is correct. However, some questions are of different types like matching type, arrange the sequence, true and false statements and questions based on passages apart from simple multiple choice questions. After the questions, the key has been provided for each question. The rationale of some questions has also been given which will help you to solve these questions. The rest of the questions, you solve yourself by exercising your thinking, reasoning ability and logic.
