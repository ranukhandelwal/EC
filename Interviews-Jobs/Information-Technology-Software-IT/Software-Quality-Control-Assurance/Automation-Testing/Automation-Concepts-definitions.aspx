<br>The V-model is one of the widely used model in many projects. Though its basically a verification-validation cycle, similar methods are being used for the testing activity too. This would help us realizing the basic need for a change in the model. 1. What is the V- model. The figure 1 shows the brief description of the V-Model kind of testing. Every phase of the STLC in this model corresponds to some activity in the SDLC. The Requirement Analysis would correspondingly have an acceptance Testing activity at the end. The design has Integration Testing (IT) and the System Integration Testing (SIT) and so on.

<br>Though all these activities are present, The testing activity formally starts at the fag end of the Coding phase or the Unit Testing activity by the developers. We note that V-model doesn't say that testing activity should formally start after coding and it's just a mapping of development phase with respect to various testing levels. But the key point here is to convey how to make testing in conjunction with V diagram development phases so that the testing effort in later stages can be minimized
